### endaq-ide

`endaq.ide` contains high-level utility functions to aid in importing and inspecting enDAQ IDE recording files. Key functions/features include:

* `get_channel_table()`
* `get_doc()`
* `to_pandas()`

Usage examples can be found here: [endaq.ide examples.ipynb](endaq.ide examples.ipynb). See the source code and documentation for more information.

*Note: This is a component of the `endaq` package; it is separate to allow users to install it independently, avoiding the core `endaq-python` dependencies. It is included in a full `endaq` install.*
